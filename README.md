  Improvement: I replaced the inner two while loops in pig.py with if-statements checking the turn condition. I did this since            all three while loops had the "not done" condition and it seemed repetetive to have two nested while loops. This should cut the Big-Theta runtime for the program down to linear from quadratic.
